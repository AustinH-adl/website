TO DO:
- Manipulate the existing base.html and connected .html files to resemble the layouts designed by Ed
    - After further tinkering discovered the aforementioned hard way is the best way to approach it and is fairly easy to get sorted out. So now it's in the right spot and rendering properly but needs edits in bootstrap.css and/or bootstrap-theme.css to get looking like the prototype page. The elements in these css files of interest are the "navbar-default" related ones.
    - Nearly gotten the blog posts to look like the prototype, only minor fixes left!
    - Constructed some rather basic styling for the right band bar. Still needs some tinkering as far as sizes, and spacing goes.

TO DO:
- Deal with the local version of the blogs template html file not rendering
	- Alternatively, make a new index page from scratch, and work in the django for the blog posts manually
- Manipulate the existing base.html and connected .html files to resemble the layouts designed by Ed
- Implement a django app for the calender widget
- Implement a django database app for the storage of member lists as well as a member registration page
